# Oz Shell Gnome Extension

This is a Gnome Shell extension for interfacing with the [OZ application sandboxing framework](https://github.com/subgraph/oz).

It allows viewing the running sandboxes, adding and removing user files into the sandboxes, terminating them, and opening a shell terminal inside the sandbox.

## Installation

You need to have `gjs` installed , so if it is not already:

```
apt-get install gjs
```

If you are running grsecurity/pax you will require to disable the mprotect pax flag on the `gjs` executable as with most JIT.

If you would like to get rid of this dependency you could write a small python, c, or golang program to replace the small Gtk filechooser in `openFiles.js`.

# Building

```
cd ozshell-gnome-extension
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
# To install for your user:
make local-install
# To install globally:
sudo make install
# To generate a distribution zip:
make zip
```

You can now install the applet: go into `gnome-tweak-tool`; you may require to reload gnome-shell (<alt-f2> enter `r` and press <enter>).

## Formalities

### Caveats

Currently the refresh is done by clearing the whole menu and rebuilding it.
This is not only inefficient, but it means that the applet will not refresh if the menu is open.
This should be fixed in the future by a) going through the items and individually removing/inserting them, 
b) the addition of push events (will require additional components to be added to `oz-daemon`).
